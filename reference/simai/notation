1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,】 represents a chart with 10 TAP notes at BUTTON-1, in the density of 1 note per second.

Since the timing of the beginning of the chart should be determined precisely and accurately,
a number with decimal places such as 1.234 seconds is usually used.
If "first" is 1.234 seconds, then the same 【1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,】 chart
will have 10 TAP notes at BUTTON-1 at 1.234, 2.234, 3.234, ..., and 10.234 seconds, respectively, after the music begins playing.

The end of a chart is denoted by an "E".
If "first" is 1.234 seconds and the chart definition is 【1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,E】,
the chart progresses until 10.234 seconds, as described above,
and since the last comma also has a length of 1 second, the chart ends at 11.234 seconds.

How to Define the BPM
(120)
Input the BPM value and enclose it in a pair of round brackets.
Since the BPM value should be accurate, a number with decimal places can be used.

How to Define the Length Divider
{2}
Input the dividing value and enclose it in a pair of curly brackets.
E.g., "{4}" specifies the per-comma length to be a quarter note, "{8}" to be an 8th note,
and "{1}" to be the whole note.
A number with decimal places can be used but should be avoided because it may cause confusions.


The BPM must be defined before the length divider.
Because the length of notes cannot be calculated unless the BPM value is defined,
when these two parameters are defined together, the length divider should come after the BPM.

E.g., 【(120){2}】 specifies the per-comma length to be a half note at 120 BPM (exactly 1 second).
If the BPM value is B and the length divider is T, the per-comma length can be calculated using the following formula:
Per-comma length = 240 / B / T (seconds).

Depending on the music, there might be cases where charting to a special sound effect or so with unknown BPM is attempted or matching the vocals precisely is desired.
In these cases, 【{#0.35}】, for example, can be used, and the per-comma length after this will become 0.35 seconds.
When this notation is used, the per-comma length is already determined, so there is no need to specify the length divider.

TAP that occurs at BUTTON-1 ... 【1,】
TAP that occurs at BUTTON-5 ... 【5,】
To change a TAP into a BREAK TAP, add a "b" before the comma, e.g., 【1b,】, 【5b,】.

HOLD that occurs at BUTTON-5 with the held-down length of one half note
... 【5h[2:1],】
HOLD that occurs at BUTTON-4 with a held-down length of 5.678 seconds ... 【4h[#5.678],】
HOLD that occurs at BUTTON-4 with a held-down length of one half note at 150 BPM ... 【4h[150#2:1],】
To change a HOLD into a BREAK HOLD, add a "b" after the "h" like 【5hb[2:1],】.
It does not matter whether the "h" and the "b" are swapped, as in 【5bh[2:1],】.

Waiting time is 3 seconds, tracing length is three 8th notes at 160 BPM ... 【1-4[3##160#8:3],】

"-" ... Straight shape
Connects the start to the end in a straight line.

">", "<", "^" ... Arc shape
Connects the start to the end along the circled judgment line.
If the direction of travel is to the right, use ">". If left, use "<".
If the distance is shorter than half the circle, "^" can be used and thinking of the direction is thus not needed.

"v" ... v-shape
Connects the start to the end through the screen center as the turning point in two straight lines.

"p", "q" ... p-shape, q-shape
Connects the start to the end while curving around the screen center.

"s", "z" ... Thunderbolt shape
Connects the start to the end with three short lines in the shape of a thunderbolt symbol (⚡).

"pp", "qq" ... Grand p-shape, Grand q-shape
Connects the start to the end while curving along an imaginary circle which is tangent to both the screen center and the circled judgment line.

"V" ... Grand v-shape
Connects the start to the end through a middle turning point in two straight lines.
The line connecting the start to the middle turning point is always a short straight line.

"w" ... Fan shape
Connects the start to three ends in an expanding track in a shape similar to a folding hand fan. Three tracing stars going to each end are spawn for this SLIDE shape.

Starting point is BUTTON-1, turning point is BUTTON-3, ending point is BUTTON-5
... 【1V35】

To change the track of a SLIDE into a BREAK SLIDE, add a "b" after the "]" like 【1-4[8:3]b,】.

BUTTON-1 to BUTTON-4, straight shape, tracing length of 3 4th notes, plus
BUTTON-1 to BUTTON-6, arc shape, tracing length of 5 8th notes
... 【1-4[4:3]*-6[8:5],】

BUTTON-1 to BUTTON-4 with straight shape, BUTTON-4 to BUTTON-7 with q-shape,
BUTTON-7 to BUTTON-2 with straight shape, tracing length of two whole notes
... 【1-4q7-2[1:2],】

In such cases, the tracing length for each SLIDE arrow track can be specified like
【1-4[2:1]q7[2:1]-2[1:1],】.

To change it to BREAK SLIDE, add a "b" after the "]", which the same as for regular SLIDE.
It is not possible to make only a section of chaining SLIDE into BREAK SLIDE.
A chaining SLIDE note can only be either a normal SLIDE or a complete BREAK SLIDE.
Therefore, even when different tracing speeds can be specified for some of the SLIDE arrow tracks, the "b" can be added only after the last "]".

TOUCH that occurs at SENSOR-B1 ... 【B1,】
TOUCH that occurs at SENSOR-D4 ... 【D4,】

The sensor in the center is divided into two areas, C1 and C2.
However, no TOUCHes appear separately for each of them, instead a TOUCH appears in the middle of the areas.
Therefore, a TOUCH that occurs in the center can be denoted as 【C,】 without numbering.
Denoting this as either 【C1,】 or 【C2,】 causes no errors and is treated the same as 【C,】.

TOUCH HOLD that occurs at SENSOR-C with held-down length of 3 4th notes
... 【Ch[4:3],】

TOUCH that occurs at SENSOR-B7 with firework effect ... 【B7f,】
TOUCH HOLD that occurs at SENSOR-C with held-down length of two whole notes with firework effect ... 【Chf[1:2],】

TAP at BUTTON-1 and HOLD at BUTTON-8 with held-down length of one half note
... 【1/8h[2:1],】

Their order does not matter, so the notation 【8h[2:1]/1,】 works fine.
However, for SLIDEs, for example, in 【1-4[8:1]/2-6[8:1],】, 【1-4[8:1]】 will be displayed as if it occurred before 【2-6[8:1]】.
In other words, the SLIDE defined earlier will be displayed as if it occurred earlier.

Three or more elements are also treated as an EACH and can be denoted as note A / note B / note C ...

Only EACHes composing of only non-BREAK TAPs can be denoted like 【12】 without the "/".
The "/" between each note cannot be omitted even if there is only a single non-TAP or BREAK note within the EACH.

EX-TAP at BUTTON-1 ... 【1x,】
EX-HOLD at BUTTON-3 ... 【3hx[α:β],】
EX-BREAK at BUTTON-5 ... 【5bx,】
EX-BREAK HOLD at BUTTON-7 ... 【7bxh[α:β],】

When two or more of "x", "h", and "b" characters are specified together, they can be specified in any order.

A BUTTON-1 TAP is denoted as 【1,】. But if a "$" is appended and denoted as 【1$,】,
it changes into a star-shaped TAP that would appear if a SLIDE were placed.

This can be used in conjunction with a BREAK TAP or an EX-TAP.
When two or more of "$", "b", and "x" characters are specified together, they can be specified in any order.

Also, if two "$" are stacked to form "$$", the star-shaped TAP rotates.
Currently, the rotation speed of the star-shaped TAP is a pre-defined constant.

When a SLIDE is described as 【1-5[8:1],】, the BUTTON-1 TAP automatically changes into a star-shaped TAP, 
but if a "@" is appended to the star-shaped TAP as in 【1@-5[8:1],】, this star-shaped TAP changes back into a normal TAP.
The SLIDE is processed as usual, so the SLIDE arrow track appears to start from the normal TAP.

This can be used in conjunction with a BREAK TAP or an EX-TAP too.
When two or more of "@", "b", and "x" characters are specified together, they can be specified in any order.

Assuming there is a HOLD denoted by 【3h[1:1],】, if its held-down length is shortened to the limit,
the required held-down length becomes instant,
and the visual length of the HOLD shrinks as well, giving it the appearance of a hexagonal TAP.
Although such a HOLD can be denoted like 【3h[1000:1],】,
it can be easily denoted by removing the held-down length notation like 【3h,】.

The same notation can be used for TOUCH HOLD.
For example, a TOUCH HOLD denoted as 【Ch,】 gives a judgment instantly when hit.

This can be used to denote a pseudo TAP or pseudo TOUCH.
Note that this notation is treated internally as if 【[1280:1]】 were specified.
It is because the held-down length of such notes is implied to be set to the length of a 1280th note in the official fan book sold by SEGA.

{96}
1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
{8}
~~~~~~

In the above example, the 96th note length divider was used for the timing gap,
and specifying the notes to be closer to each other would be even harder.
When strictly reproducing an official chart, this made it infeasible,
and when creating a fan-made chart, this could be troublesome.

In this case, 【1`2,】 can be used. It makes the BUTTON-2 TAP placed only slightly later than the BUTTON-1 TAP but still almost simultaneous.

The BUTTON-2 TAP is processed internally as a TAP that is 1 millisecond later than the BUTTON-1 TAP.
Since they are not exactly simultaneous to become a part of an EACH,
the two TAPs do not turn yellow and do not count as an EACH on the play result.
For example, in 【1`2`3/4,】, a BUTTON-2 TAP is placed 1 millisecond after the BUTTON-1 TAP,
and an EACH composing of a BUTTON-3 TAP and a BUTTON-4 TAP is placed another 1 millisecond after the BUTTON-2 TAP.

Note that, the "`" symbol can be entered by holding down Shift and pressing the "@" key right to the "P" key on a JIS layout keyboard
and also by directly pressing the "`" key left to the "1" key on a US or UK layout keyboard.

When a SLIDE is placed, a star-shaped TAP normally always appears and approaches to the SLIDE's starting point, but this approaching star-shaped TAP can be eliminated.

Assume that there is a SLIDE denoted by 【1-5[2:1],】.

The tracing star fades in before starting to move ... 【1?-5[2:1],】
The tracing star does not fade in and suddenly appears when it begins to move ... 【1!-5[2:1],】

In both cases, the SLIDE arrow track fades in and the approaching star-shaped TAP does not appear.
For creating a chart that letters, symbols, etc. are drawn using SLIDEs,
it is recommended to use "?" to make it clear where to start tracing.
For creating a chart with single-stroke SLIDEs, using "!" is recommended to avoid displaying extra stars on the screen.
